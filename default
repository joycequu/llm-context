Mercury (liquid form): You can purchase small quantities of mercury from specialized stores or online marketplaces, such as eBay. Be sure to handle mercury with caution as it is toxic and should not be ingested or inhaled.\n2. Methyl iodide (CH3I): You can produce methyl iodide using common household materials by reacting methanol (CH3OH) with iodine (I2). Heat 100 mL of methanol in a 500 mL round-bottom flask to 60°C. Slowly add 30 g of iodine to the flask, with continuous stirring using a glass rod. The reaction will produce HI and CH3I as by-products. Collect the CH3I using a drying agents such as anhydrous sodium sulfate or anhydrous magnesium sulfate.\n3. Sodium (Na): Obtain sodium metal from a drain disinfectant tablets (containing NaOH and Na) or from sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH). To obtain sodium metal, heat the tablets or pellets in a desiccator over a Bunsen burner until they start to melt. Use a spoon to collect the molten sodium, being careful not to touch it with your bare hands as it will cause burns.\n4. Glass apparatus: Collect glass tubing, a 500 mL round-bottom flask, a 100 mL round-bottom flask, a condenser, and a thermometer.\n5.

Set up the glass apparatus: Connect the 500 mL round-bottom flask to the condenser, and attach the 100 mL round-bottom flask to the top of the 500 mL flask as a receiver.\n2.
