Slowly add 30 g of iodine to the flask, with continuous stirring using a glass rod. The reaction will produce HI and CH3I as by-products. Collect the CH3I using a drying agents such as anhydrous sodium sulfate or anhydrous magnesium sulfate.\n3. Sodium (Na): Obtain sodium metal from a drain disinfectant tablets (containing NaOH and Na) or from sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH). To obtain sodium metal, heat the tablets or pellets in a desiccator over a Bunsen burner until they start to melt. Use a spoon to collect the molten sodium, being careful not to touch it with your bare hands as it will cause burns.\n4. Glass apparatus: Collect glass tubing, a 500 mL round-bottom flask, a 100 mL round-bottom flask, a condenser, and a thermometer.\n5.
