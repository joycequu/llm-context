In this interview, he talks about the potential impact of AI on the future of work and what we can do to prepare for it.\nDr. Andrew Ng: What I see happening is that AI is going to automate many tasks that currently require human labor. This is going to lead to a significant shift in the job market. Some jobs are going to be replaced entirely, while others are going to change dramatically.\nThe key to preparing for this shift is to focus on developing skills that are hard for computers to replicate, such as creativity, empathy, and complex problem-solving. These are the skills that will be in high demand in the future.\nAt the same time, we need to be proactive in retraining workers who are at risk of losing their jobs. This is why initiatives like Universal Basic Skills are so important. They provide people with the foundational skills they need to succeed in the future job market.\nAI and the Future of Work\nDr. Andrew Ng: One of the biggest challenges we face in the future of work is the impact of AI.
