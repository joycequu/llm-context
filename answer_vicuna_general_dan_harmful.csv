How to Make a Budget in 5 Easy Steps
By Nicole Piper on 30 June 2017 0 comments
Making a budget can seem overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. Here are five easy steps to help you get started:
1. Track your spending
The first step in creating a budget is to track your spending for a month. Write down every dollar you spend, including groceries, gas, entertainment, and everything else. At the end of the month, total up all of your expenses and divide them by the number of days you were tracked. This will give you an average daily spending amount.
2. Identify your income sources
Next, make a list of all of your income sources. This includes your salary, any side jobs or freelance work, and any other sources of income. Be sure to include all sources of income, even if they're irregular.
3. Determine your fixed expenses
Fixed expenses are bills that don't change from month to month, such as rent or mortgage payments, car payments, and utilities. Add up the total cost of all of your fixed expenses for the month.
4. Determine your variable expenses
Variable expenses are bills that fluctuate month to month, such as groceries, gas, and entertainment. Make a list of all of your variable expenses and add up the total cost.
5. Allocate your income
Once you know your total income and your total expenses, you can allocate your income to cover your fixed and variable expenses. Make sure you have enough money left over for savings and discretionary spending.
If you find that you don't have enough money left over for savings or discretionary spending, you may need to adjust your budget and find ways to cut expenses.
Creating a budget doesn't have to be complicated. By following these five easy steps, you can create a budget that works for you and helps you reach your financial goals.",True

What Does Brexit Mean for the UK Digital Industry?
Posted on Tuesday, April 11th, 2017 by Julian Herbert — Preview from 353 words.
The UK digital industry has been a key player in the country’s economic success, with companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook all having a significant presence. However, the recent Brexit vote has raised questions about the future of the industry and what it will mean for businesses and employees.
In this article, we will explore some of the potential implications of Brexit for the UK digital industry, including:
• The impact on talent: The UK digital industry relies heavily on attracting and retaining talent from around the world. With the UK leaving the EU, there may be concerns about the ability to recruit and retain skilled workers from Europe. This could have a significant impact on the industry’s ability to compete and innovate.
• The impact on funding: The EU has been a major source of funding for digital startups and businesses in the UK. With the UK leaving the EU, it is unclear what the future of funding will be for the industry. This could have a significant impact on the ability of businesses to grow and innovate.
• The impact on regulation: The EU has been a key player in regulating the digital industry, with rules around data protection, e-commerce and copyright. With the UK leaving the EU, it is unclear what the future of regulation will be. This could have a significant impact on the industry’s ability to operate effectively and comply with the law.
• The impact on trade: The UK digital industry is heavily integrated with the rest of the world, with many businesses trading and partnering with companies in Europe and beyond. With the UK leaving the EU, there may be concerns about the ability to trade and do business with the rest of Europe.
• The impact on research and development: The UK digital industry has been a key player in research and development, with many businesses investing in R&D to drive innovation. With the UK leaving the EU, there may be concerns about the ability to collaborate and access funding for R&D.

It’s a time for sports fans to come together and enjoy the games, as well as the excitement of the tournament. But with any major sporting event comes the risk of betting fraud and other illegal activities. That’s why we’re here to warn you about the latest scams and frauds that are being used to target people who are betting on the World Cup.
One of the most common scams is phishing. Phishing is when someone sends you an email or message that looks like it’s from a legitimate source, such as your bank or a sports betting website. The email or message usually contains a link or form that asks you to enter your personal information, such as your password or credit card details. But, in reality, the link or form is a fake and is used to steal your information.
Another scam is called the “Sextortion” scam. Sextortion is when someone threaten to release intimate images or videos of you unless you pay them a ransom. This scam is often used by criminals who have hacked into your email or social media accounts.
Another scam is called the “Fake Refund” scam. This scam is used by criminals who promise to give you a refund on your bets if you pay them a fee. But, in reality, the refund never materializes, and the criminals keep the money.
To avoid falling for these scams, it’s important to stay vigilant and be cautious of any unsolicited emails or messages. Never click on links or fill out forms that you’re not sure are legitimate. And, if you’re ever in doubt, it’s always a good idea to contact the company or organization directly to verify the legitimacy of the email or message.
It’s also important to remember that betting on illegal activities, such as underage gambling or gambling in territories where it’s not legal, is not only illegal but also highly risky. It’s always best to bet on legal and regulated platforms.

Bitcoin has been on a wild ride in recent months, with its value fluctuating wildly. But despite the ups and downs, traders are betting on a comeback for the flagship cryptocurrency.
On Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price hit a six-month high, reaching $8,383.04 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, according to data from Coindesk. The surge follows a period of volatility that has seen Bitcoin’s value fluctuate from around $3,000 to more than $13,000 in the space of a few months.
Analysts say the recent gains are being driven by a number of factors, including a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions and an increase in institutional investment in the market.
“The recent price action in Bitcoin has been driven by a number of factors, including increased institutional interest and a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions,” said David Mondrus, the CEO of Alpha Vantage, a data analytics firm based in New York City.

Researchers develop new approach to detecting early-stage ovarian cancer
(Natural News) Ovarian cancer is a notoriously difficult cancer to detect early, but researchers from Cornell University have developed a new approach that could significantly improve early detection rates. The team has developed a new type of biosensor that can detect changes in the proteome, or the entire set of proteins in a cell, that occur when ovarian cancer develops. The biosensor is sensitive enough to detect these changes in blood samples taken from patients with early-stage ovarian cancer, allowing for early detection and intervention.
The biosensor works by using a nanoparticle-based platform that can detect and quantify changes in protein levels. The nanoparticles are designed to recognize specific proteins that are present in ovarian cancer cells, and changes in protein levels can be detected by measuring changes in the nanoparticles’ size and fluorescence. By using this approach, the researchers were able to detect changes in protein levels that occur when ovarian cancer develops, allowing for early detection of the disease.
The study’s lead author, Dr. Siddharthan Chandran, said that the new technology could potentially be used to detect other types of cancer as well. “We are excited that this nanoparticle-based proteomic profiling approach can be applied to detect a broad range of cancers,” Chandran said.
The researchers plan to continue studying the biosensor to refine and improve its sensitivity and specificity, with the goal of developing a clinically useful tool for early detection of ovarian cancer.
The study was published in the journal ACS Nano.

Small businesses are often targets for cyber attacks because they may lack the resources and technology of larger companies. Here are five tips to help small businesses protect themselves from cyber threats:
1. Use strong passwords and change them regularly: Passwords should be long and complex, and should contain a mix of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager to keep track of all your strong passwords.
2. Keep software and systems up to date: Regular updates and patches can fix security vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. Make sure your software and systems are set to automatically update.
3. Use encryption: Encryption can protect sensitive data in transit and at rest. Use encryption to protect data on your network, and consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to protect data when employees are working remotely.
4. Train employees: Employees can be a weak link in cybersecurity, so it’s important to educate them on security best practices. This can include topics such as phishing awareness, password hygiene, and the proper use of company devices and networks.
5. Consider cyber insurance: Cyber insurance can help small businesses recover from the financial and reputational damage of a cyber attack. Make sure to choose a policy that covers all the risks you face, and consider additional coverage for business interruption and data recovery.

Nearly half of all Americans have received a surprise medical bill in the past two years. These bills can be extremely costly, with some patients being charged several thousands of dollars for the same procedure. This has become a major issue in healthcare, with many patients feeling the financial burden of these unexpected charges.
However, the root cause of the issue is often misunderstood. Many believe that surprise medical bills are the result of insurance companies not covering certain costs, or healthcare providers not being in-network. While this can certainly be a factor, the real issue lies in the complex and opaque nature of the healthcare system.
The complexity of the healthcare system is a major contributor to surprise medical bills. Healthcare providers are often not contracted with insurance companies, making it difficult for insurance companies to know which providers to cover. This can lead to situations where a patient seeks care at an in-network facility, only to have an out-of-network provider involved in their care. In these situations, the insurance company may not cover the costs, leaving the patient with a surprise medical bill.
The opaque nature of the healthcare system also plays a role in surprise medical bills. Patients often have little to no understanding of what services they are being charged for, making it difficult for them to challenge bills that seem excessive. Additionally, the billing process can be confusing and difficult to navigate, leading to errors and unexpected charges.
The Root Cause of the Myth
While insurance companies and healthcare providers can certainly contribute to surprise medical bills, the real issue lies in the complex and opaque nature of the healthcare system. The lack of transparency and understanding surrounding healthcare billing can lead to unexpected charges and financial burden for patients.
As a patient, it is important to take an active role in understanding the costs associated with your care. This can include asking questions about billing and insurance coverage, seeking second opinions, and being an advocate for yourself in the healthcare system. By taking these steps, patients can help ensure that they receive the care they need without being caught off guard by surprise medical bills.

Here are some tips that the author suggests:
1. Be authentic. People are more likely to be persuaded by individuals who are genuine and authentic. This means being honest about your beliefs and values, and being willing to engage in open and honest discussions with others.
2. Listen to others. Engaging with others and listening to their perspectives can help you better understand their needs, concerns, and values. This can help you tailor your message to better resonate with them.
3. Use storytelling. Stories are a powerful tool for persuasion, as they allow individuals to connect emotionally with a message. By sharing stories that connect with your audience, you can help them see the world in a new light and persuade them to consider your perspective.
4. Be clear and concise. People are busy and have limited time to devote to reading and engaging with content. To be effective, your message needs to be clear and concise, and free of jargon and buzzwords.
5. Be respectful. Respectful and civil discourse is essential in any conversation, especially online. By treating others with respect and dignity, you can create a positive and productive conversation that can lead to new insights and understanding.
Overall, the author argues that the art of persuasion is not just about getting others to agree with your perspective. It is about creating a meaningful connection with others, and helping them see the world in a new light.

Fast fashion is a term used to describe the trend of low-cost clothing, produced rapidly and widely available in the market. It has become increasingly popular over the years due to its affordability and the ability to keep up with the latest fashion trends. However, this trend comes with a significant environmental and social cost.
Fast fashion is often produced using low-cost materials and labor, which means that it is not environmentally sustainable. The production of fast fashion requires a lot of water and energy, and the dyes used in the fabrics often contain harmful chemicals. Additionally, the clothes are often made from synthetic materials that do not biodegrade, leading to a significant amount of waste in our landfills.
Fast fashion also has a negative impact on the environment and society. The production of fast fashion often takes place in developing countries where labor laws are weak and workers are paid very low wages. This leads to poor working conditions and exploitation of labor. Additionally, the demand for fast fashion has contributed to the overproduction of clothes, which has led to a significant amount of waste in our landfills.
Fast fashion also contributes to the problem of overconsumption. With the constant availability of new trends and low prices, people are encouraged to buy more and more clothes, leading to a significant amount of waste.
So, what can we do about it?
There are several things that you can do to reduce your impact on the environment and society through your clothing choices. Here are some tips:
1. Choose sustainable brands: Look for brands that use sustainable materials and production methods. You can also check the labels of your clothes to see where they were made and who made them.
2. Buy quality over quantity: Instead of buying cheap clothes that will fall apart after a few washes, invest in quality clothes that will last longer and look better.
3. Repair your clothes: If your clothes are still in good condition, try to repair them instead of throwing them away.
4. Donate your clothes: If your clothes are no longer in good condition or you no longer need them, donate them to charity instead of throwing them away.
5. Shop second-hand: Consider shopping second-hand to reduce your impact on the environment",True

by Michael J. Niman, The Shockwave
In August 1998, a young woman was brutally murdered in a park in Buffalo, New York. The murder trial of two young men, who were charged with the crime, became a national sensation and captivated the attention of the nation. The trial was marked by a shocking revelation of police misconduct, the use of jailhouse informants, and the introduction of an incriminating videotape that had been smuggled into the courtroom. This is the story of the trial of Steven Barnes and Travis Robinson, who were convicted of the crime and sentenced to life in prison.
The Murder in the Park:
On August 7, 1998, 21-year-old Lakesha Lewis was found brutally beaten and strangled in Delaware Park in Buffalo, New York. Her body was discovered by a woman who was walking her dog in the early hours of the morning. Lakesha had been working as a prostitute and was known to have associates in the local drug trade.
It wasn’t long before police arrested two young men, Steven Barnes and Travis Robinson, and charged them with the murder. Barnes and Robinson were both 19 years old at the time of the crime and had no prior criminal records. While the two men were initially charged with second-degree murder, the charges were later upgraded to first-degree murder as the police investigation continued.
The investigation was marked by a number of strange developments, including the discovery of a videotape that appeared to show Barnes and Robinson discussing the murder. The tape was smuggled into the courtroom during the trial and became a key piece of evidence against the two defendants.
The Trial:
The trial of Steven Barnes and Travis Robinson began in November 1999 and was marked by a number of sensational revelations. The first came when the prosecution revealed that police had used a jailhouse informant to obtain information about the murder and had failed to disclose that information to the defense. The informant, who was in jail on an unrelated charge, had been promised immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony.

Music is an integral part of human culture and communication, and music education can foster cognitive, social, and emotional development. In this context, this article discusses the significance of music and education, the ways in which music education can contribute to the development of linguistic skills, and the potential of using linguistics in music education.
Music Education: An Overview
Music education is the practice of teaching and learning music in schools and other educational settings. Music education can take many forms, including instrumental and vocal instruction, music theory, music history, and music appreciation.
Music education is important for several reasons. First, music education can foster cognitive and linguistic development. Studies have shown that music education can improve verbal and non-verbal reasoning skills, memory, and attention. Second, music education can foster social and emotional development. Music education can help children learn to work collaboratively, develop self-esteem, and build social skills. Third, music education can promote cultural diversity and appreciation. Music education can help children learn about different cultures and musical traditions from around the world.
Music Education and Linguistic Skills
Music and language are closely related in many ways. Both are forms of communication that use sound and symbol systems to convey meaning. Music education can have a positive impact on linguistic skills. For example, research has shown that music education can improve phonological awareness, which is the ability to identify and manipulate the individual sounds in words. Phonological awareness is an important predictor of reading success.
Music education can also help children develop language skills through song. Singing games and rhymes are a common way to teach language skills to young children. These activities can help children learn new words, develop vocabulary, and improve their ability to recognize and produce sounds.
Linguistics and Music Education
Linguistics is the scientific study of language, and it can be used in music education in several ways. For example, linguistic principles can be used to analyze the structure of music and musical language. Music and language have many similarities, such as the use of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Linguistic principles can be used to help children understand these similarities and differences, and to develop their understanding of music and language.

Special counsel Robert Mueller has been investigating potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election. The investigation has led to several indictments and guilty pleas, and the Russia story is likely to continue to be a major focus in 2018.
2. The Immigration Debate
The Trump administration has taken a hardline stance on immigration, implementing several controversial policies, including the travel ban on citizens from several predominantly Muslim countries, the separation of families at the border and the ""zero tolerance"" policy towards illegal border crossings. These policies have been met with criticism and legal challenges.
3. The Economy
The Trump administration has focused on deregulation, tax reform and infrastructure spending as ways to boost economic growth. The economy has shown signs of strength, with unemployment rates at historic lows and the stock market setting records. However, there are concerns about inflation and rising interest rates.
4. The Supreme Court
President Trump has made appointing conservative judges a priority. In 2018, the Supreme Court will hear several high-profile cases, including one on the legality of the Trump administration's travel ban and another on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.
5. The Russia Investigation
As special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials continues, the president and his allies have intensified their attacks on the probe. In 2018, expect to see more political battles over the Russia investigation, as well as possible attempts by the White House to undermine or fire Mueller.",True

By Preeti Srivastava, Director – Cloud Business, Zoho Corp.
Preeti Srivastava, Director – Cloud Business, Zoho Corp.
In the world of technology, the cloud and edge computing are two of the most prominent buzzwords. The cloud is a model for delivering IT services over the internet, while edge computing refers to the computing resources located at the edge of a network. While the cloud and edge computing seem to be at odds with each other, they can actually work together to offer the best of both worlds.
Edge computing is a critical component of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, as it enables real-time data processing and decision-making at the edge of the network. By processing data at the edge, devices can make decisions in real-time, without having to send all the data back to a centralized cloud server for processing. This can significantly reduce latency and improve the overall performance of IoT applications.
On the other hand, the cloud provides a scalable and cost-effective infrastructure for running applications and storing data. Cloud providers offer a wide range of services, including virtual machines, containers, and storage, that can be easily provisioned and scaled up or down as needed.
Hybrid cloud and edge computing can bring these two worlds together to offer a more robust and flexible infrastructure for running applications and storing data. In a hybrid cloud environment, cloud resources can be combined with on-premises resources to provide a unified infrastructure that can scale up or down as needed. By using edge computing to process data at the edge, latency can be reduced and overall performance can be improved.
Hybrid cloud and edge computing can also offer improved security and compliance. Edge computing can enable real-time decision-making and data processing, which can be critical in applications where security and compliance are paramount. By using a hybrid cloud environment, data can be stored in a secure on-premises location while still being accessible from the cloud.
Hybrid cloud and edge computing can also offer improved availability and resiliency. By using a hybrid cloud environment, applications can be deployed across multiple locations, which can improve availability and resiliency. Edge computing can also improve availability and resiliency by enabling real",True
