How to Make a Budget in 5 Easy Steps
By Nicole Piper on 30 June 2017 0 comments
Making a budget can seem overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. Here are five easy steps to help you get started:
1. Track your spending
The first step in creating a budget is to track your spending for a month. Write down every dollar you spend, including groceries, gas, entertainment, and everything else. At the end of the month, total up all of your expenses and divide them by the number of days you were tracked. This will give you an average daily spending amount.
2. Identify your income sources
Next, make a list of all of your income sources. This includes your salary, any side jobs or freelance work, and any other sources of income. Be sure to include all sources of income, even if they're irregular.
3. Determine your fixed expenses
Fixed expenses are bills that don't change from month to month, such as rent or mortgage payments, car payments, and utilities. Add up the total cost of all of your fixed expenses for the month.
4. Determine your variable expenses
Variable expenses are bills that fluctuate month to month, such as groceries, gas, and entertainment. Make a list of all of your variable expenses and add up the total cost.
5. Allocate your income
Once you know your total income and your total expenses, you can allocate your income to cover your fixed and variable expenses. Make sure you have enough money left over for savings and discretionary spending.
If you find that you don't have enough money left over for savings or discretionary spending, you may need to adjust your budget and find ways to cut expenses.
Creating a budget doesn't have to be complicated. By following these five easy steps, you can create a budget that works for you and helps you reach your financial goals.",True

What Does Brexit Mean for the UK Digital Industry?
Posted on Tuesday, April 11th, 2017 by Julian Herbert — Preview from 353 words.
The UK digital industry has been a key player in the country’s economic success, with companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook all having a significant presence. However, the recent Brexit vote has raised questions about the future of the industry and what it will mean for businesses and employees.
In this article, we will explore some of the potential implications of Brexit for the UK digital industry, including:
• The impact on talent: The UK digital industry relies heavily on attracting and retaining talent from around the world. With the UK leaving the EU, there may be concerns about the ability to recruit and retain skilled workers from Europe. This could have a significant impact on the industry’s ability to compete and innovate.
• The impact on funding: The EU has been a major source of funding for digital startups and businesses in the UK. With the UK leaving the EU, it is unclear what the future of funding will be for the industry. This could have a significant impact on the ability of businesses to grow and innovate.
• The impact on regulation: The EU has been a key player in regulating the digital industry, with rules around data protection, e-commerce and copyright. With the UK leaving the EU, it is unclear what the future of regulation will be. This could have a significant impact on the industry’s ability to operate effectively and comply with the law.
• The impact on trade: The UK digital industry is heavily integrated with the rest of the world, with many businesses trading and partnering with companies in Europe and beyond. With the UK leaving the EU, there may be concerns about the ability to trade and do business with the rest of Europe.
• The impact on research and development: The UK digital industry has been a key player in research and development, with many businesses investing in R&D to drive innovation. With the UK leaving the EU, there may be concerns about the ability to collaborate and access funding for R&D.

It’s a time for sports fans to come together and enjoy the games, as well as the excitement of the tournament. But with any major sporting event comes the risk of betting fraud and other illegal activities. That’s why we’re here to warn you about the latest scams and frauds that are being used to target people who are betting on the World Cup.
One of the most common scams is phishing. Phishing is when someone sends you an email or message that looks like it’s from a legitimate source, such as your bank or a sports betting website. The email or message usually contains a link or form that asks you to enter your personal information, such as your password or credit card details. But, in reality, the link or form is a fake and is used to steal your information.
Another scam is called the “Sextortion” scam. Sextortion is when someone threaten to release intimate images or videos of you unless you pay them a ransom. This scam is often used by criminals who have hacked into your email or social media accounts.
Another scam is called the “Fake Refund” scam. This scam is used by criminals who promise to give you a refund on your bets if you pay them a fee. But, in reality, the refund never materializes, and the criminals keep the money.
To avoid falling for these scams, it’s important to stay vigilant and be cautious of any unsolicited emails or messages. Never click on links or fill out forms that you’re not sure are legitimate. And, if you’re ever in doubt, it’s always a good idea to contact the company or organization directly to verify the legitimacy of the email or message.
It’s also important to remember that betting on illegal activities, such as underage gambling or gambling in territories where it’s not legal, is not only illegal but also highly risky. It’s always best to bet on legal and regulated platforms.
In conclusion, with the 2022 World Cup approaching, it’s important to be aware of the risks of betting fraud and other illegal activities. By staying vigil",True

Bitcoin has been on a wild ride in recent months, with its value fluctuating wildly. But despite the ups and downs, traders are betting on a comeback for the flagship cryptocurrency.
On Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price hit a six-month high, reaching $8,383.04 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, according to data from Coindesk. The surge follows a period of volatility that has seen Bitcoin’s value fluctuate from around $3,000 to more than $13,000 in the space of a few months.
Analysts say the recent gains are being driven by a number of factors, including a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions and an increase in institutional investment in the market.
“The recent price action in Bitcoin has been driven by a number of factors, including increased institutional interest and a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions,” said David Mondrus, the CEO of Alpha Vantage, a data analytics firm based in New York City.
Mondrus added that the recent gains are also being driven by a number of technical factors, including the development of new trading algorithms and a growing number of market participants.

Researchers develop new approach to detecting early-stage ovarian cancer
(Natural News) Ovarian cancer is a notoriously difficult cancer to detect early, but researchers from Cornell University have developed a new approach that could significantly improve early detection rates. The team has developed a new type of biosensor that can detect changes in the proteome, or the entire set of proteins in a cell, that occur when ovarian cancer develops. The biosensor is sensitive enough to detect these changes in blood samples taken from patients with early-stage ovarian cancer, allowing for early detection and intervention.
The biosensor works by using a nanoparticle-based platform that can detect and quantify changes in protein levels. The nanoparticles are designed to recognize specific proteins that are present in ovarian cancer cells, and changes in protein levels can be detected by measuring changes in the nanoparticles’ size and fluorescence. By using this approach, the researchers were able to detect changes in protein levels that occur when ovarian cancer develops, allowing for early detection of the disease.
The study’s lead author, Dr. Siddharthan Chandran, said that the new technology could potentially be used to detect other types of cancer as well. “We are excited that this nanoparticle-based proteomic profiling approach can be applied to detect a broad range of cancers,” Chandran said.
The researchers plan to continue studying the biosensor to refine and improve its sensitivity and specificity, with the goal of developing a clinically useful tool for early detection of ovarian cancer.
The study was published in the journal ACS Nano.

Small businesses are often targets for cyber attacks because they may lack the resources and technology of larger companies. Here are five tips to help small businesses protect themselves from cyber threats:
1. Use strong passwords and change them regularly: Passwords should be long and complex, and should contain a mix of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager to keep track of all your strong passwords.
2. Keep software and systems up to date: Regular updates and patches can fix security vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. Make sure your software and systems are set to automatically update.
3. Use encryption: Encryption can protect sensitive data in transit and at rest. Use encryption to protect data on your network, and consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to protect data when employees are working remotely.
4. Train employees: Employees can be a weak link in cybersecurity, so it’s important to educate them on security best practices. This can include topics such as phishing awareness, password hygiene, and the proper use of company devices and networks.
5. Consider cyber insurance: Cyber insurance can help small businesses recover from the financial and reputational damage of a cyber attack. Make sure to choose a policy that covers all the risks you face, and consider additional coverage for business interruption and data recovery.

Nearly half of all Americans have received a surprise medical bill in the past two years. These bills can be extremely costly, with some patients being charged several thousands of dollars for the same procedure. This has become a major issue in healthcare, with many patients feeling the financial burden of these unexpected charges.
However, the root cause of the issue is often misunderstood. Many believe that surprise medical bills are the result of insurance companies not covering certain costs, or healthcare providers not being in-network. While this can certainly be a factor, the real issue lies in the complex and opaque nature of the healthcare system.
The complexity of the healthcare system is a major contributor to surprise medical bills. Healthcare providers are often not contracted with insurance companies, making it difficult for insurance companies to know which providers to cover. This can lead to situations where a patient seeks care at an in-network facility, only to have an out-of-network provider involved in their care. In these situations, the insurance company may not cover the costs, leaving the patient with a surprise medical bill.
The opaque nature of the healthcare system also plays a role in surprise medical bills. Patients often have little to no understanding of what services they are being charged for, making it difficult for them to challenge bills that seem excessive. Additionally, the billing process can be confusing and difficult to navigate, leading to errors and unexpected charges.
The Root Cause of the Myth
While insurance companies and healthcare providers can certainly contribute to surprise medical bills, the real issue lies in the complex and opaque nature of the healthcare system. The lack of transparency and understanding surrounding healthcare billing can lead to unexpected charges and financial burden for patients.
As a patient, it is important to take an active role in understanding the costs associated with your care. This can include asking questions about billing and insurance coverage, seeking second opinions, and being an advocate for yourself in the healthcare system. By taking these steps, patients can help ensure that they receive the care they need without being caught off guard by surprise medical bills.
